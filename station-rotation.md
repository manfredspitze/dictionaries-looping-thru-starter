# Station Rotation
## Looping Through Python Dictionaries

### Directions
- Complete the stations in order.
- Create a new GitHub repo online named: **dict_stations**
- Upload your code to this repo
- Be prepared to discuss your work today with your teacher and the rest of the class.

---

### Station 1
- Using VS Code editor
- *Write code to loop through a dictionary and print both the keys and values contained in the dictionary.*
- Add 4 - 5 countries and their capital cities to a dictionary
- Look up a country's capital online if you're not sure what it is
- Have Python write a sentence that says what the capital of each country is
- Work with your assigned partner to write the code

---

### Station 2
- Using VS Code editor
- *Modify your script using the `keys()` method so only the keys from your dictionary print*
- Work with your assigned partner to write the code

---

### Station 3
- Using VS Code editor
- Have your script search for a specific value in the dictionary
- Create a dictionary with four (4) key:value pairs; each key:value pair should represent the **book's author** (the key) and the **book's title** (the value)
- Search the dictionary for a specific author using the `input()` function and an if statement
- Tell the user if the specific author is present in the dictionary (or not)
- Work with your assigned partner to write the code

---

### Station 4
- Using VS Code editor
- *Write a simple script that loops through all the student names and grades in a dictionary.  Calculate the class average for the exam.*
- Create a dictionary containing the first names and exam grades for five (5) students; make the name the key and the exam score the value
- Print a sentence that lists each student's name and exam score
- Which dictionary method would you use in this case -- `keys()`, `values()` or `items()`?
- Individual work
