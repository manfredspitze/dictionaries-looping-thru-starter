# Station Rotation
## Looping Through Python Dictionaries

### Directions
- Complete the stations in order.
- Create a new GitHub repo online named: **dict_stations**
- Upload your code to this repo
- Be prepared to discuss your work today with your teacher and the rest of the class.

---

### Station 1
- Using VS Code editor
- *Write code to loop through a dictionary and print both the keys and values contained in the dictionary.*
- Work with your assigned partner to write the code

---

### Station 2
- Using VS Code editor
- *Modify your script using the `keys()` method so only the keys from your dictionary print.*
- Work with your assigned partner to write the code

---

### Station 3
- Using VS Code editor
- *Modify your script so it searches for a specific value in your dictionary.  Use a `for` loop and an if statement to do this.*
- Use the `values()` method with your dictionary
- Work with your assigned partner to write the code

---

### Station 4
- Using VS Code editor
- *Write a simple script that loops through all the student names and grades in a dictionary.  Calculate the class average for the exam.*
- Which dictionary method would you use in this case -- `keys()`, `values()` or `items()`?
- Individual work
